//! Build- and render-phase budgets and their meters.
//!
//! Resource use in this crate is explicit rather than emergent. A caller
//! states the ceilings, the meter counts what is actually spent, and every
//! store checks its ceiling and then reserves fallibly, so exhaustion is
//! reported at the API rather than felt as allocator pressure somewhere below
//! it.
//!
//! Build accounting and render accounting are disjoint, and this is load
//! bearing: a document that is expensive to construct cannot quietly consume
//! the budget the renderer was promised, and a limit crossed during
//! finalization can never be reported as a render limit.
//!
//! # The binding defaults
//!
//! | limit                                           | default    |
//! | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
//! | stored document nodes, including flatten images | 1,000,000  |
//! | uniquely stored text and verbatim bytes         | 64 MiB     |
//! | stored verbatim physical fragments              | 1,000,000  |
//! | constructor and finalization build steps        | 20,000,000 |
//!
//! # What slice one owns here
//!
//! The two records below are data and are complete. The meter's operations are
//! not representable without bodies, so their exact intended signatures are
//! stated here and slice one implements them:
//!
//! ```text
//! impl BuildMeter {
//!     pub fn try_new(limits: BuildLimits) -> Result<Self, BuildError>;
//!     pub fn usage(&self) -> BuildUsage;
//! }
//!
//! impl Default for BuildLimits;
//! ```
//!
//! [`BuildMeter`] is neither `Clone` nor `Default`, its fields stay private,
//! and it exposes no way to reset or decrement a cumulative counter. A standing
//! client creates one meter per document; a client that emits a document in
//! segments reuses the same meter across every segment, which is what stops a
//! long run from resetting its own accounting between pieces.
