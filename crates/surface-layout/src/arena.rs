//! The sealed document arena and the node algebra it stores.
//!
//! A document is a directed acyclic graph of nodes held in flat, grow-only
//! stores. Every stored edge points at an earlier node in the same builder, so
//! the graph is acyclic by construction rather than by a check. Identities are
//! dense insertion ordinals: they never move, never recycle, and are not
//! content identities.
//!
//! Sharing is the point of the arena. A subdocument referenced twice is stored
//! once and resolved once per distinct layout context, which is what keeps a
//! large printed term from re-walking its own shape.
//!
//! # The node semantics
//!
//! | node       | semantics                                                                                                          |
//! | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
//! | `Empty`    | Emits nothing and changes neither column nor indentation.                                                           |
//! | `Text`     | Emits its newline-free string at the current column.                                                                |
//! | `Verbatim` | Emits its exact stored bytes; later physical lines begin at column zero with whatever indentation the bytes carry.  |
//! | `Line`     | Emits the configured physical ending and the current indentation; under flattening it emits one space.              |
//! | `HardLine` | Emits the ending and the indentation even under flattening, which is what protects a line comment.                  |
//! | `Concat`   | Unaligned concatenation: resolve the left, then the right at the left's ending column, keeping the indentation.     |
//! | `Nest`     | Resolves its child with the indentation raised by a checked amount.                                                 |
//! | `Align`    | Resolves its child with the indentation set to the current column.                                                  |
//! | `Choice`   | Admits every layout of either child and merges their measure sets.                                                  |
//! | `Flatten`  | Uses the memoized flattened image of its child, turning `Line` into one space and leaving `HardLine` and verbatim.  |
//!
//! Unaligned concatenation is the feature that makes the resolver's second cost
//! dimension necessary: a locally more expensive left layout can leave a column
//! that makes everything after it cheaper.
//!
//! # Physical text
//!
//! Text is newline-free and rejects a carriage return, a line feed, and a tab;
//! a client expands its own tabs before construction. Verbatim text is the
//! separate opaque carrier for content that must survive byte-identical. Its
//! scan produces one record per physical fragment — including the empty final
//! fragment after a trailing ending — and each record stores that fragment's
//! checked scalar width and the exact ending that follows it, so the stored
//! bytes and the stored metrics cannot disagree. Verbatim text is inert to
//! flattening: neither a `Flatten` node nor a surrounding group may rewrite its
//! newlines or its internal indentation.
//!
//! The first fragment extends the incoming column. After a stored ending, every
//! later fragment starts at absolute column zero, so middle widths are absolute
//! line widths and the ending column is the final fragment's width.
//!
//! # What slice one owns here
//!
//! The types below are data and are complete. The arena's own operations need
//! bodies, so their exact intended signatures are stated here:
//!
//! ```text
//! impl DocArena {
//!     pub fn node_count(&self) -> DocNodesUsed;
//!     pub fn contains(&self, doc: DocId) -> DocHandleStatus;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `DocHandleStatus` is a two-valued nominal enum rather than a `bool`, and it
//! is slice one's to introduce beside the impl.
//!
//! Identity minting, verbatim scanning, and the flatten interner are private to
//! [`crate::build`]; nothing here hands out a raw ordinal.
