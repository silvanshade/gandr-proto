//! Semantic wrappers for primitive values crossing the VDC reflection boundary.
//!
//! These wrappers keep Rust primitives out of crate-defined signatures while
//! naming each scalar in the vocabulary of the reflected
//! virtual-double-category layer. All wrappers are representation-transparent
//! and expose only explicit conversions.

/// Generates a `#[repr(transparent)]` `Copy` newtype over a scalar carrier,
/// with both `From` conversions.
