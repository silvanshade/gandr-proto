//! The **zero-drift differential**: every incremental verdict is compared
//! against the batch acyclicity answer over the same edge set, offer by offer.
//!
//! The comparison is direct rather than translated. The incremental structure
//! refuses with a [`gandr_theory_graphs::CycleWitness`] and the batch oracle
//! answers with the same type, so a divergence is a disagreement about the
//! graph and never about how two vocabularies line up.
//!
//! Four things are checked at every step, and the last two are what make this a
//! differential rather than a smoke test: the verdict matches the batch answer;
//! a refusal's witness is a closed walk whose every edge is really present; the
//! maintained order is still topological; and the retained graph is still
//! acyclic under the batch traversal.
//!
//! # The teeth
//!
//! A differential nobody has seen fail proves nothing about its own
//! sensitivity, so `the_differential_catches_a_seeded_wrong_verdict` runs the
//! same harness with one verdict deliberately reported backwards — at every
//! position in turn — and requires the comparison to reject each run. The
//! companion corruption, a maintained order rewritten behind the structure's
//! back, is seeded in the crate's own unit tests where the private state is
//! reachable.
