//! The **weighted-edge probe**: where the graph-theoretic maintenance stops
//! agreeing with the offset-carrying one.
//!
//! The same edge stream is offered twice — once to
//! [`gandr_theory_dynamic_graphs::AcyclicityMaintenance`], which sees only the
//! edges, and once to [`gandr_theory_dynamic_graphs::PotentialMaintenance`],
//! which sees the offsets too. The probe records where their verdicts first
//! disagree, which is well defined precisely up to that point: before it the
//! two structures hold the same admitted set, and after it they do not, so
//! nothing past the first divergence is a comparison of like with like.
//!
//! # What is being located
//!
//! Acyclicity is a sound and incomplete approximation of offset satisfiability.
//! It is **exactly** complete when every offset is at least one, because every
//! cycle then sums positive and is genuinely unsatisfiable. Admit a zero offset
//! and completeness fails: a cycle summing to zero forces its nodes to share a
//! value and is satisfiable, while no topological order can hold it.
//!
//! So the probe is not looking for a bug. It measures the price of the
//! approximation as a function of the offsets — the divergence rate and the
//! stream depth at which the cheaper structure first over-refuses — and it pins
//! the direction: the order structure refuses a **superset** of what the
//! valuation refuses, never the other way round.
