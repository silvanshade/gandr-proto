//! The order oracle over canonical levels — [`Level::leq_with_evidence`] and
//! [`Level::lt_with_evidence`] — together with the evidence vocabulary and
//! the validators that check evidence against its levels.
//!
//! The decision is **domination** on canonical forms: `l ≤ m` at every
//! valuation exactly when (i) each atom `x + a` of `l` has a same-variable
//! atom `x + b` in `m` with `a ≤ b` (a spike valuation on `x` refutes
//! anything less), and (ii) `l`'s constant part is at most `m`'s value at the
//! zero valuation (which is where a constant violation shows). Strict order
//! is the same comparison with the left side shifted up by one — `l < m` iff
//! `l + 1 ≤ m` over the naturals.
